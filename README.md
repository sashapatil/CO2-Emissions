# Global CO2 Emissions Dashboard - Interactive Tableau Visualization
## Project Overview
This project involves creating an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes 250 years of global CO2 emissions data. The objective is to explore, analyze, and present data trends for CO2 emissions, focusing on individual countries and their contributions over time. The dashboard will display various insights into global CO2 trends, including CO2 emissions per capita, total emissions, and the relationship between CO2 emissions and population.

## Dataset
- Name: Global CO2 Emissions Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- File Format: CSV
- Records: 50,599

## Process
In this project, I cleaned, filtered, and prepared the CO2 emissions dataset for visualization. I then created three key visualizations: a line chart to show CO2 trends over time, a map displaying emissions per capita by country, and a scatter plot comparing emissions with population. Finally, I combined these into an interactive dashboard, allowing users to explore the data with dynamic filters and parameters for a more in-depth analysis.
